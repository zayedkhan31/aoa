Recursive algorithm.
Runs in O(NlogN) time.
Basic idea: If we have two sorted arrays, we can merge them in linear time 
with N comparisons only. Given an array to be sorted, we can consider separately 
its left half and its right half, sort them and then merge them.

Where is the recursion?
Each half is an array that can be sorted using the same algorithm - 
divide into two, sort separately the left and the right halves, and then merge them.

Example
Merging two sorted arrays:
Array A: 3, 7, 10, 15
Array B: 1, 4, 8, 9, 20
Array C: (merged) 
1, 3, 4, 7, 8, 9, 10, 15, 20
Mergesorting an array:
6, 9, 1, 10, 34, 12, 15, 8

The following figure gives the state of the array at each step of the mergesort algorithm. 
Each splitting is indicated in blue, each merging - in purple.
Parts merged at some previous step are in gray.



Analysis of MergeSort Algorithm
Algorithm:

 
mergesort( int [] a, int left, int right)
{
	if (right > left)
	{
		middle = left + (right - left)/2;
		mergesort(a, left, middle);
		mergesort(a, middle+1, right);
		merge(a, left, middle, right);
	}
}	
Assumption: N is a power of two.

For N = 1: time is a constant (denoted by 1)

Otherwise: time to mergesort N elements = time to mergesort N/2 elements plus
time to merge two arrays each N/2 elements.

Time to merge two arrays each N/2 elements is linear, i.e. N

Thus we have:

(1) T(1) = 1

(2) T(N) = 2T(N/2) + N

Next we will solve this recurrence relation. First we divide (2) by N:

(3) T(N) / N = T(N/2) / (N/2) + 1

N is a power of two, so we can write

(4) T(N/2) / (N/2) = T(N/4) / (N/4) +1

(5) T(N/4) / (N/4) = T(N/8) / (N/8) +1
(6) T(N/8) / (N/8) = T(N/16) / (N/16) +1
(7) ……
(8) T(2) / 2 = T(1) / 1 + 1
Now we add equations (3) through (8) : the sum of their left-hand sides 
will be equal to the sum of their right-hand sides:

T(N) / N + T(N/2) / (N/2) + T(N/4) / (N/4) + … + T(2)/2 =

T(N/2) / (N/2) + T(N/4) / (N/4) + ….+ T(2) / 2 + T(1) / 1 + LogN

(LogN is the sum of 1s in the right-hand sides)

After crossing the equal term, we get

(9) T(N)/N = T(1)/1 + LogN

T(1) is 1, hence we obtain

(10) T(N) = N + NlogN = O(NlogN)

Hence the complexity of the MergeSort algorithm is O(NlogN).
